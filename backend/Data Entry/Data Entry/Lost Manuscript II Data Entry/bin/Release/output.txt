Node (22) Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute: The Rensselaer School was established in Troy, New York, in 1824 by Stephen Van Rensselaer, along with educator and scientist Amos Eaton, “for the purpose of instructing persons ... in the application of science to the common purposes of life.” It is “...the first school of science and school of civil engineering, which has had a continuous existence, to be established in any English-speaking country.”  In 1833 the school became the Rensselaer Institute, and in the 1850s its purpose was broadened to become a polytechnic institution, thus the name was changed in 1861 to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
Node (41) Old Bank Place: <color=#0000ffff>Old Bank Place is part of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. </color>The Rensselaer School began its existence in a single building known as the Old Bank Place on the northwest corner of River and Middleburgh Streets. The structure was erected in 1801 to house Troy's first bank, the Farmer's Bank. Amos Eaton acquired the building on a lease in 1821. The Rensselaer School opened at the Old Bank Place on January 5, 1825 and remained there until 1834. The building housed laboratories with scientific instruments and specimens, an observatory, a library, lecture rooms and living quarters for the students and the Eaton family. The school leased the Van der Heyden Mansion from 1834-1841 then returned to the Old Bank Place in 1841. An 1841 catalog describes the site as "airy, healthy, and rural, surrounded by fields, hills and groves." Rensselaer remained at the Old Bank Place until 1844.<color=#800080ff> We'll hear more about Old Bank Place is replacement of, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is part of later.

Node (48) Infant School Property: <color=#0000ffff>Infant School Property is replacement of Old Bank Place. </color>The Rensselaer Institute found itself without a home when the Old Bank Place was claimed as part of the Amos Eaton estate in 1844. The City of Troy offered to give the Institute property formerly known as the Infant School on the condition that William P. Van Rensselaer provide an endowment equal to the value of the property. The Institute remained at this site until a disastrous fire destroyed much of downtown Troy in 1862.
