Node (41) Old Bank Place: The Rensselaer School began its existence in a single building known as the Old Bank Place on the northwest corner of River and Middleburgh Streets. The structure was erected in 1801 to house Troy's first bank, the Farmer's Bank. Amos Eaton acquired the building on a lease in 1821. The Rensselaer School opened at the Old Bank Place on January 5, 1825 and remained there until 1834. The building housed laboratories with scientific instruments and specimens, an observatory, a library, lecture rooms and living quarters for the students and the Eaton family. The school leased the Van der Heyden Mansion from 1834-1841 then returned to the Old Bank Place in 1841. An 1841 catalog describes the site as "airy, healthy, and rural, surrounded by fields, hills and groves." Rensselaer remained at the Old Bank Place until 1844.

The four-story brick building, erected on land given by the Warren family, was completed in 1864. The facility included a library, assembly hall, lecture and recitation rooms, drawing rooms, cabinets of natural history specimens and laboratories. In 1874, the year of the semicentennial, stained glassed windows were installed in memory of Amos Eaton, Civil War veterans and former professors. The Main Building was gutted by a fire on June 9, 1904. The property was turned over to the City of Troy and the Approach, a massive granite staircase, was completed on the site in 1907.<color=#800080ff> We'll hear more about Main Building replaced by, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute alma mater of, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute includes, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute includes Main Building replaced by, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute alma mater of, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute includes, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute includes later.

Node (45) Palmer Chamberlain Ricketts, President: Ricketts was appointed Director of the Institute in 1892. In 1901 the director position was expanded to encompass all administrative duties and Ricketts was appointed as the first administrative president. Ten academic buildings (referred to as the green roof campus) and twenty-nine dormitory units were constructed under his supervision.  Ricketts died while in office on December 9, 1934. A laboratory completed in 1935 was named the Ricketts Building in his honor.

Ricketts was born in Elkton, MD on Jan. 17, 1856 and later moved to New Jersey. He prepared under a private tutor at Princeton, NJ and entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1871 at the age of fifteen. Ricketts was an average student. One of his few activities was the 1874 Transit (yearbook) editorial board. His graduating thesis was titled, Review of the Substructure of the Wrought Iron Girder Bridge over the Hudson River at Troy. 
Node (21) Troy, NY: <color=#0000ffff>Troy, NY is location of Palmer Chamberlain Ricketts, Student. </color>Troy is a city in the U.S. State of New York and the seat of Rensselaer County. The city is located on the western edge of Rensselaer County and on the eastern bank of the Hudson River. Troy has close ties to the nearby cities of Albany and Schenectady, forming a region popularly called the Capital District. The city is one of the three major centers for the Albany Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). 
Node (23) The Approach: <color=#0000ffff>The Approach located in Troy, NY. </color>The Approach is a massive granite staircase between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and downtown Troy. It was completed in 1907 on the former site of Rensselaer's Main Building. The staircase was constructed by the City of Troy to emphasize the interdependence of this industrial city and the polytechnic school for which it is known. After devastating fires ravaged Rensselaer's Winslow Chemical Laboratory and destroyed the Main Building in 1904, trustees and administrators considered a proposal to merge with the Columbia University School of Mines in New York City. Institute officials decided to stay in Troy, but to move further East up the hill. The city responded by spending $40,000 to extend Broadway to the new campus in the form of a grand staircase. <color=#ff00ffff> And as it turns out, The Approach is replacement of Main Building. </color><color=#ff00ffff> And as it turns out, The Approach is part of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. </color>
