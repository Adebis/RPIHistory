Node (22) Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute:  This is buffer audio for audacity. For the whole graph, it makes a 'w' shape up until 2015. 
		 You can see the start of the 'w' at 1995, and the low point before the middle at 2003. 
		 However, on the left, the first leg's kind of stunted, and the whole left side looks too long.
	     
Node (41) Old Bank Place: <color=#0000ffff>Old Bank Place is part of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. </color>The Rensselaer School began its existence in a single building known as the Old Bank Place on the northwest corner of River and Middleburgh Streets. The structure was erected in 1801 to house Troy's first bank, the Farmer's Bank. Amos Eaton acquired the building on a lease in 1821. The Rensselaer School opened at the Old Bank Place on January 5, 1825 and remained there until 1834. The building housed laboratories with scientific instruments and specimens, an observatory, a library, lecture rooms and living quarters for the students and the Eaton family. The school leased the Van der Heyden Mansion from 1834-1841 then returned to the Old Bank Place in 1841. An 1841 catalog describes the site as "airy, healthy, and rural, surrounded by fields, hills and groves." Rensselaer remained at the Old Bank Place until 1844.<color=#800080ff> We'll hear more about Old Bank Place is replacement of, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is part of later.

Node (8) Main Building: The Main Building was the first building designed and built for the Rensselaer Institute in 1864. The facility included a library, assembly hall, lecture and recitation rooms, drawing rooms, cabinets of natural history specimens and laboratories. The Main Building was gutted by a fire on June 9, 1904. The property was turned over to the City of Troy and the Approach, a massive granite staircase, was completed on the site in 1907.
Node (23) The Approach: <color=#0000ffff>The Approach is replacement of Main Building. </color>The Approach is a massive granite staircase that leads to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute campus from downtown Troy. It was completed in 1907 on the former site of Rensselaer's Main Building. The staircase was constructed by the City of Troy to emphasize the interdependence of this industrial city and the polytechnic school for which it is known. After devastating fires ravaged Rensselaer's Winslow Chemical Laboratory and destroyed the Main Building in 1904, the city responded by spending $40,000 to extend Broadway to the new campus in the form of a grand staircase.
