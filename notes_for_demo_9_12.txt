- Tell them what you're going to show them (a demo of our
narrative generation AI agent. This is an agent that, as the
name implies, generates narratives about some underlying dataset)
- The dataset here being one about the history of RPI's campus, as
built using the RPI Library's digital archives.
1. Press enter to reveal first node, RPI itself.
- Explain the parts of the visualization, and explain that RPI is something
of a super-node in the dataset because it's connected to everything.
2. Proceed to second node, Old Bank Place.
- Because this is from the RPI library's digital archives, it has access 
to some interesting digitized artifacts.
- old bank place letter example.
3. Play the audio for the letter.
- The agent generates narratives using a suite of narrative techniques
- Point out colored text in story journal
- Underlying it all is some set of what we call "Anchor Points."
- these are topics in the system which a data expert or a system designer
has designated as important.
- For example, over the course of this particular narrative that the system
has generated, you will see the development of RPI's buildings and campus.
- However, the system does have a measure of interactivity. For example, 
here, the system has chosen this spot in the narrative it has generated to give
the user a turn to directly input a topic they are interested in.
- So, here, let's say I'm interested in Palmer Chamberlain Ricketts, an influential
person in RPI's history.
4. Click on Palmer Chamberlain Ricketts, student
- We can see that the agent is pausing the narrative it has already planned about
the history of RPI's buildings and campus and has generated a new arc based on this new topic.
5. Proceed to next node, PCR, faculty
6. Proceed to next node, PCR, president
7. Proceed to next node, Infant Building 
- And we see now the agent has elected to go back to its original story lines,
and it's giving the user this reminder of where it left off.
8. Proceed through story line to The Approach
- Point out somewhere here that, with the map and the timeline,
we can see how the development of RPI's campus has sort of climbed
up the hill.
